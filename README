NAME
    Test::Time - Overrides the time() and sleep() core functions for testing

SYNOPSIS
        use Test::Time;

        # Freeze time
        my $now = time();

        # Increment internal time (returns immediately)
        sleep 1;

        # Return internal time incremented by 1
        my $then = time();

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Time can be used to test modules that deal with time. Once you
    "use" this module, all references to "time" and "sleep" will be
    internalized. You can set custom time by passing time => number after
    the "use" statement:

        use Test::Time time => 1;

        my $now = time;    # $now is equal to 1
        sleep 300;         # returns immediately, displaying a note
        my $then = time;   # $then equals to 301
